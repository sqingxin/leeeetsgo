# 695. Max Area of Island
Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

**Example 1:**
```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```
Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
**Note:** 
The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.

分析：
显然要用dfs深度优先搜索，遍历每个值为1的元素的四个方向的元素，将组成group的位置置为0防止再次被判断到。

``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int x;
    int y;
    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        if(grid.size() == 0)
            return 0;
        x = grid.size();
        y = grid[0].size();
        int max = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < x; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < y; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                    int p = bfs(grid, i, j);
                    if(p > max)
                        max = p;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
    
    int bfs(vector<vector<int> > &grid, int i, int j){
        int sum = 0;
        if(i >= 0 && i < x && j >= 0 && j < y && grid[i][j] == 1){
            grid[i][j] = 0;
            sum++;
            sum += bfs(grid, i  ,j-1);
            sum += bfs(grid, i+1,j);
            sum += bfs(grid, i  ,j+1);
            sum += bfs(grid, i-1,j);
        }
        return sum;
    }
        
};
```
